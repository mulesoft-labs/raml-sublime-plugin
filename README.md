RAML Syntax Highlighter for Sublime
===================================

This is a simple syntax highlighter for the RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/).

RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices.

##File associations

With this package, Sublime Text will recognize `raml` files as having RAML syntax.

##Installation:


Using Package Control:
---------------------
 If you don't have Package Control installed in Sublime, please follow [this instructions](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).

 - Go to your package control palette, by pressing ctrl+shift+p (Win,
    Linux) or cmd+shift+p (OS X). 
    
 - Type "Package Control: Install Package"
    
 - Type "RAML Syntax Highlighter" in the search toolbar and press Enter. The plugin will be downloaded and installed automatically

Manual installation:
-------------------

 - The easiest way to install is just copying the `sublime-package` file (bundled with the [releases](https://github.com/restful-api-modeling-lang/raml-sumblime-plugin/releases)) to the Installed Packages folder of your personal Sublime Text folder.
          
 - For Windows users, that's likely located in `%appdata%\Sublime Text 2`.

 - You could also install it by copying the files into a `Sublime Text 2\Packages\RAML` folder (creating the RAML folder previously).


After installing the plugin, you will be able to use it by going to View -> Syntax -> RAML.
Once selected, you will see the RAML label on the bottom right of the screen.
